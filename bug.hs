This Haskell code attempts to use a function from a module that hasn't been imported. This is a common mistake, but can be tricky to debug because the compiler might not always give a clear error message if the missing function happens to have the same name as a function in a different module that *has* been imported. 
```haskell
-- This code will produce a runtime error

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = someFunction 5 -- someFunction is not defined
  print result
```
